<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Driven Gas Boosters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting</li><li>Double Acting</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air-driven gas boosters are devices that increase the pressure of gases using compressed air. The market typically includes two types: single-acting and double-acting boosters. Single-acting boosters utilize air pressure on one side of the piston to compress gas on the opposite side during the piston's downward stroke. In contrast, double-acting boosters work by applying air pressure on both sides of the piston, effectively utilizing both strokes for enhanced efficiency and higher pressure outputs. This allows for more versatile applications in various industries.</p></p>
